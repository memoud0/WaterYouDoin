We’re building a browser extension that helps developers use AI more intentionally by reducing unnecessary AI calls at the source. Instead of relying on large language models to analyze prompts, the extension uses lightweight, locally executed NLP techniques to classify user input before it is sent to an AI assistant such as ChatGPT.
Each prompt is categorized as factual, low-value, or reasoning-heavy. Factual queries—such as definitions, dates, or simple lookups—are automatically redirected to a non–AI-powered search engine, ensuring that information is still accessible without triggering hidden AI compute. Low-value prompts, such as conversational messages or duplicate requests, are filtered locally without making any external calls. When a prompt requires deeper reasoning or problem-solving, the extension introduces a subtle cognitive nudge that encourages developers to pause and think through the problem before proceeding, while always preserving the option to use AI immediately.
All classification, decision-making, and metrics tracking run entirely in the browser, with no backend services and no AI inference. To promote transparency and sustainability, the extension visualizes the environmental impact of avoided AI calls through a menu-bar interface that estimates water savings. This impact is represented by an animated ice cube mascot whose state reflects usage patterns—remaining solid when AI usage is intentional, reacting thoughtfully when users pause to reason, and gradually melting with excessive reliance.
By combining local NLP, non–AI-powered redirection, and developer-friendly UX design, the extension encourages better prompt hygiene, preserves developer autonomy, and promotes more sustainable AI usage without disrupting real software engineering workflows.
